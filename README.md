<h1>Programmable Microcontroller Timer in Vivado</h1>
Designed and implemented a complex programmable timer
for a microcontroller using Vivado, featuring congurable
intervals, precise clock management, and event-driven
triggers. Utilized VHDL for hardware description, integrated
with microcontroller peripherals, and optimized timing logic
for deterministic performance.
